	abstract = {The first artificial reverberation algorithms were proposed in the early 1960s, and new, improved algorithms are published regularly. These algorithms have been widely used in music production since the 1970s, and now find applications in new fields, such as game audio. This overview article provides a unified review of the various approaches to digital artificial reverberation. The three main categories have been delay networks, convolution-based algorithms, and physical room models. Delay-network and convolution techniques have been competing in popularity in the music technology field, and are often employed to produce a desired perceptual or artistic effect. In applications including virtual reality, predictive acoustic modeling, and computer-aided design of acoustic spaces, accuracy is desired, and physical models have been mainly used, although, due to their computational complexity, they are currently mainly used for simplified geometries or to generate reverberation impulse responses for use with a convolution method. With the increase of computing power, all these approaches will be available in real time. A recent trend in audio technology is the emulation of analog artificial reverberation units, such as spring reverberators, using signal processing algorithms. As a case study we present an improved parametric model for a spring reverberation unit.},

	abstract = {Differentiable machine learning techniques have recently proved effective for finding the parameters of Feedback Delay Networks ({FDNs}) so that their output matches desired perceptual qualities of target room impulse responses. However, we show that existing methods tend to fail at modeling the frequency-dependent behavior of sound energy decay that characterizes real-world environments unless properly trained. In this paper, we introduce a novel perceptual loss function based on the mel-scale energy decay relief, which generalizes the well-known time-domain energy decay curve to multiple frequency bands. We also augment the prototype {FDN} by incorporating differentiable wideband attenuation and output filters, and train them via backpropagation along with the other model parameters. The proposed approach improves upon existing strategies for designing and training differentiable {FDNs}, making it more suitable for audio processing applications where realistic and controllable artificial reverberation is desirable, such as gaming, music production, and virtual reality.},

            Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the design of artificial reverberation algorithms aimed at emulating the room acoustics of physical environments. Despite significant advancements, automatic parameter tuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novel method for finding the parameters of a feedback delay network ({FDN}) such that its output renders target attributes of a measured room impulse response. The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable {FDN} with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a perceptually motivated time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent {FDNs} capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical {FDN} design.},

	title = {A Method for matching room impulse responses with feedback delay networks},
	abstract = {Recorded room impulse responses enable accurate and high-quality artiﬁcial reverberation. Used in combination with convolution, they can be computationally expensive and inﬂexible, providing little control to the user. On the other hand, reverberation algorithms are parametric which enable user control. However, they can lack realism and can be challenging to conﬁgure. To address these limitations, we introduce a multi-stage approach to optimize the coefﬁcients of a Feedback Delay Network ({FDN}) reverberator to match a target room impulse response, thus enabling parametric control. In the ﬁrst stage, we conﬁgure some {FDN} parameters by extracting features from the target impulse response. Then, we use a genetic algorithm to ﬁt the remaining parameters to match the desired impulse response using a Mel-frequency cepstrum coefﬁcients ({MFCCs}) cost function. We evaluate our approach across a dataset of impulse responses and conducted a subjective listening test. Our results indicate that the combination of the {FDN} with a short truncation of the target impulse response enables a better approximation, however, there are still differences with respect to the overall spectrum and the clarity factor in some more challenging cases.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to improve the state-of-the-art in delay-networkbased analysis-synthesis of measured room impulse responses ({RIRs}). We propose an informed method incorporating improved energy decay estimation and synthesis with an optimized feedback delay network. The performance of the presented method is compared against an end-to-end deep-learning approach. A formal listening test was conducted where participants assessed the similarity of reverberated material across seven distinct {RIRs} and three different sound sources. The results reveal that the performance of these methods is influenced by both the excitation sounds and the reverberation conditions. Nonetheless, the proposed method consistently demonstrates higher similarity ratings compared to the end-to-end approach across most conditions. However, achieving an indistinguishable synthesis of measured {RIRs} remains a persistent challenge, underscoring the complexity of this problem. Overall, this work helps improve the sound quality of analysis-based artificial reverberation.},

	abstract = {Delay networks are a common parametric method to synthesize the late part of the room reverberation. A delay network consists of several feedback loops, each containing a delay line and an attenuation filter, which approximates the same decay rate by appropriately setting the frequency-dependent loop gain. A remaining challenge is the design of the attenuation filters on a wide frequency range based on a measured room impulse response. This letter proposes a novel two-stage attenuation filter structure, sharpening the design. The first stage is a low-order pre-filter approximating the overall shape and determining the decay at the two ends of the frequency range, namely at the dc and the Nyquist limit. The second filter, an equalizer, fine-tunes the gain at different frequencies, such as on one-third-octave bands. It is shown that the proposed design is more accurate and robust than previous methods. A design example applying the proposed method to an interleaved velvet-noise reverberator is also exhibited. The proposed two-stage attenuation filter is a step toward a realistic parametric simulation of measured room impulse responses.},

	abstract = {A graphic equalizer is a high-order ﬁlter controlling the gain of several frequency bands. For good accuracy, graphic equalizers consisting of cascaded {IIR} ﬁlters have been of very high order. A previously proposed parallel graphic equalizer entailing twice as many second-order ﬁlter sections as there are bands can have a maximum approximation error of less than 1 {dB}, but its design is complicated. This letter proposes a cascade graphic equalizer having an accuracy comparable to the best parallel graphic equalizer, although only one second-order section is assigned per command gain. A key idea is to use band ﬁlters whose interaction with the two neighboring ﬁlters at their center frequency is exactly controlled. The ﬁlter gains are obtained using the least-squares method with one iteration step, which involves linear interpolation of the target gain vector, inversion of a square matrix, and a few matrix multiplications. The proposed method is compared with previous designs and is shown to be the most accurate one. The new graphic equalizer is widely useful for audio and music processing.},

Full-scale interactive room auralisation systems are impractical for use in computer games due to their high computational cost. As a low-cost alternative, artiﬁcial reverberators can be used. This paper is concerned with the design of a scalable interactive reverberator inspired by digital waveguide mesh ({DWM}) models and feedback delay networks ({FDN}). This reverberator is by construction tightly linked to the acoustics of the enclosure that it simulates. Simulation of unequal and frequencydependent wall absorption, as well as directional sources and microphones can also be incorporated. It is shown that the response of the proposed reverberator accurately renders the early reﬂections and room modes, as well as providing {RT}60 values consistent with Sabine and Eyring equations.},

	title = {Flexible real-time reverberation synthesis with accurate parameter control},
	abstract = {Reverberation is one of the most important effects used in audio production. Although nowadays numerous real-time implementations of artificial reverberation algorithms are available, many of them depend on a database of recorded or pre-synthesized room impulse responses, which are convolved with the input signal. Implementations that use an algorithmic approach are more flexible but do not let the users have full control over the produced sound, allowing only a few selected parameters to be altered. The realtime implementation of an artificial reverberation synthesizer presented in this study introduces an audio plugin based on a feedback delay network ({FDN}), which lets the user have full and detailed insight into the produced reverb. It allows for control of reverberation time in ten octave bands, simultaneously allowing adjusting the feedback matrix type and delay-line lengths. The proposed plugin explores various {FDN} setups, showing that the lowest useful order for high-quality sound is 16, and that in the case of a Householder matrix the implementation strongly affects the resulting reverberation. Experimenting with delay lengths and distribution demonstrates that choosing too wide or too narrow a length range is disadvantageous to the synthesized sound quality. The study also discusses {CPU} usage for different {FDN} orders and plugin states.},
