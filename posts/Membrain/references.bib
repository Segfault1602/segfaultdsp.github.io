  title    = {Efficient Snare Drum Model for Acoustic Interfaces with Piezoelectric Sensors},
  abstract = {This paper describes a computationally efﬁcient synthesis model for snare drum sounds. Its parameters can be modulated at audio rate while being played. The input to the model is an acoustic excitation signal which carries spectral information to color the output sound. This makes it suitable for acoustic interfaces – devices which provide excitation signal and control data simultaneously. The presented synthesis model builds up on work done by Miller Puckette[1] and processes audio input from a piezoelectric microphone into a nonlinear reverberator. This paper details a strikingly simple but novel approach on how to make use of the momentary {DC} offset generated by piezoelectric microphones when pressed to simulate the changes in drumhead tension. This technique is especially of interest for interfaces without pressure sensing capabilities. In the design process we pursued an experimental approach rather than a purely mathematical. Implementations of the synthesis model are provided for Pure Data and {FAUST} as open source.},

Utilizing recent work in nonlinear acoustic synthesis, we propose a transducer based augmented percussion implement entitled {DRMMR}. This design enables the user to sustain computer sequencer-like drum rolls at faster speeds while also enabling the user to achieve nonlinear acoustic synthesis eﬀects. Our acoustic evaluation shows drum rolls executed by {DRMMR} easily exhibit greater levels of regularity, speed, and precision than comparable transducer and electromagnetic-based actuation methods. {DRMMR}’s nonlinear acoustic synthesis functionality also presents possibilities for new kinds of sonic interactions on the surface of drum membranes.},

This paper presents the Tapbox and the Slapbox, two generations of a standalone {DMI} built for percussion practice. After summarizing the requirements for performance {DMIs} from previous surveys, we introduce the Tapbox and comment on its strong and weak points. We then focus on the design process of the Slapbox, an improved version that captures a broader range of percussive gestures. Design tasks are reflected upon, including enclosure design, sensor evaluations, gesture extraction algorithms, and sound synthesis methods and mappings. Practical exploration of the Slapbox by two professional percussionists is performed and their insights summarized, providing directions for future work.},

  abstract = {This paper documents the initial prototyping of a new digital musical instrument. Speciﬁcally, it focuses on design of the interface, and contextualizes the project through some of the existing research in the ﬁeld of gestural control of new musical instruments. The project began with a concept for a standalone hand-held polyphonic synthesizer called the Noisebox (Figure 1). Several key concepts and strategies were explored and implemented during its development, including: analysis and application of gesture in musical performance, choice of sensors and sensor conditioning, appropriate mapping strategies, and evaluation of user experience. The outcome yielded a functional prototype that fulﬁlled the initial goal of the project to design and build a working instrument from start to ﬁnish. The stage documented here represents the ﬁrst phase of a longer project. Future phases will conduct user tests to measure the success of the instrument based on performer feedback and reﬁne the design through multiple iterations, leading to a ﬁnished instrument.},

Our current setup uses four contact piezoelectric pickups located near the sheet's corners to record the acoustic wavefront coming from the impacts. A digital signal processor extracts relevant characteristics from these signals, such as amplitudes, frequency components, and differential timings, which are used to estimate the location of the hit and provide other parameters, including the rough position resolution, the nature of each hit (e.g., knuckle knock, metal tap, or fist bang), and the strike intensity. As this system requires only simple hardware, it needs no special adaptation of the glass pane, and allows all transducers to be mounted on the inner surface, hence it is quite easy to deploy as a retrofit to existing windows. This opens many applications, such as an interactive storefront, with content controlled by knocks on the display window.},

  abstract = {The tabla is a traditional pitched two-piece Indian drum set, popular not only within South East Asian music, but whose sounds also regularly feature in western music. Yet tabla remains an aural tradition, taught largely through a guru system heavy in custom and mystique. Tablas can also pose problems for school and professional performance environments as they are physically bulky, fragile, and reactive to environmental factors such as damp and heat. As part of a broader project to demystify tabla, we present an electronic tabla that plays nearly identically to an acoustic tabla and was created in order to make the tabla acces- sible and practical for a wider audience of students, pro- fessional musicians and composers. Along with develop- ment of standardised tabla notation and instructional educational aides, the electronic tabla is designed to be compact, robust, easily tuned, and the electronic nature allows for scoring tabla through playing. Further, used as an interface, it allows the use of learned tabla technique to control other percussive sounds. We also discuss the technological approaches used to accurately capture the localized multi-touch rapid-fire strikes and damping that combine to make tabla such a captivating and virtuosic instrument.},
