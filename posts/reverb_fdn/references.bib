	abstract = {Artificial reverberation algorithms often suffer from spectral coloration, usually in the form of metallic ringing, which impairs the perceived quality of sound. This paper proposes a method to reduce the coloration in the feedback delay network ({FDN}), a popular artificial reverberation algorithm. An optimization framework is employed entailing a differentiable {FDN} to learn a set of parameters decreasing coloration. The optimization objective is to minimize the spectral loss to obtain a flat magnitude response, with an additional temporal loss term to control the sparseness of the impulse response. The objective evaluation of the method shows a favorable narrower distribution of modal excitation while retaining the impulse response density. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method lowers perceptual coloration of late reverberation, and also shows that the suggested optimization improves sound quality for small {FDN} sizes. The method proposed in this work constitutes an improvement in the design of accurate and high-quality artificial reverberation, simultaneously offering computational savings.},

This overview article provides a unified review of the various approaches to digital artificial reverberation. The three main categories have been delay networks, convolution-based algorithms, and physical room models. Delay-network and convolution techniques have been competing in popularity in the music technology field, and are often employed to produce a desired perceptual or artistic effect. In applications including virtual reality, predictive acoustic modeling, and computer-aided design of acoustic spaces, accuracy is desired, and physical models have been mainly used, although, due to their computational complexity, they are currently mainly used for simplified geometries or to generate reverberation impulse responses for use with a convolution method. With the increase of computing power, all these approaches will be available in real time. A recent trend in audio technology is the emulation of analog artificial reverberation units, such as spring reverberators, using signal processing algorithms.

            Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the design of artificial reverberation algorithms aimed at emulating the room acoustics of physical environments. Despite significant advancements, automatic parameter tuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novel method for finding the parameters of a feedback delay network ({FDN}) such that its output renders target attributes of a measured room impulse response. The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable {FDN} with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a perceptually motivated time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent {FDNs} capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical {FDN} design.},

One central challenge in the design of {FDNs} is the generation of sufﬁcient echo density in the impulse response without compromising the computational efﬁciency. In a previous contribution, we have demonstrated that the echo density of an {FDN} can be increased by introducing so-called delay feedback matrices where each matrix entry is a scalar gain and a delay. In this contribution, we generalize the feedback matrix to arbitrary lossless ﬁlter feedback matrices ({FFMs}). As a special case, we propose the velvet feedback matrix, which can create dense impulse responses at a minimal computational cost. Further, {FFMs} can be used to emulate the scattering effects of nonspecular reﬂections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {FFMs} in terms of echo density and modal distribution.},

	abstract = {Recorded room impulse responses enable accurate and high-quality artiﬁcial reverberation. Used in combination with convolution, they can be computationally expensive and inﬂexible, providing little control to the user. On the other hand, reverberation algorithms are parametric which enable user control. However, they can lack realism and can be challenging to conﬁgure. To address these limitations, we introduce a multi-stage approach to optimize the coefﬁcients of a Feedback Delay Network ({FDN}) reverberator to match a target room impulse response, thus enabling parametric control. In the ﬁrst stage, we conﬁgure some {FDN} parameters by extracting features from the target impulse response. Then, we use a genetic algorithm to ﬁt the remaining parameters to match the desired impulse response using a Mel-frequency cepstrum coefﬁcients ({MFCCs}) cost function. We evaluate our approach across a dataset of impulse responses and conducted a subjective listening test. Our results indicate that the combination of the {FDN} with a short truncation of the target impulse response enables a better approximation, however, there are still differences with respect to the overall spectrum and the clarity factor in some more challenging cases.},

	abstract = {The reverberation time is one of the most prominent acoustical qualities of a physical room. Therefore, it is crucial that artiﬁcial reverberation algorithms match a speciﬁed target reverberation time accurately. In feedback delay networks, a popular framework for modeling room acoustics, the reverberation time is determined by combining delay and attenuation ﬁlters such that the frequencydependent attenuation response is proportional to the delay length and by this complying to a global attenuation-per-second. However, only few details are available on the attenuation ﬁlter design as the approximation errors of the ﬁlter design are often regarded negligible. In this work, we demonstrate that the error of the ﬁlter approximation propagates in a non-linear fashion to the resulting reverberation time possibly causing large deviation from the speciﬁed target. For the special case of a proportional graphic equalizer, we propose a non-linear least squares solution and demonstrate the improved accuracy with a Monte Carlo simulation.},

The first stage is a low-order pre-filter approximating the overall shape and determining the decay at the two ends of the frequency range, namely at the dc and the Nyquist limit. The second filter, an equalizer, fine-tunes the gain at different frequencies, such as on one-third-octave bands.

A key idea is to use band ﬁlters whose interaction with the two neighboring ﬁlters at their center frequency is exactly controlled.

Specially shaped tone bursts, generated on the computer, are radiated into the enclosure under study. The sound-pressure responses at different locations in the enclosure are recorded on a magnetic tape. The data are converted into digital form by an analog-to-digital converter and are processed by the digital computer. The processing by the computer includes filtering (to improve signal-to-noise ratio), envelope detection, and evaluation of different quantities having subjective or physical significance. A microfilm plotter attached to the computer is used to plot the results. Among the quantities evaluated are reverberation times based on different portions of the decay; direct, early, and reverberant energies; and directional distribution of sound-energy flux (diffusion). The different quantities are evaluated both as a function of frequency and location in the enclosure. Spatial and frequency averages of the different quantities are also evaluated.},

In this paper it is shown that the considerable variance of room acoustic parameters of almost any hall is partly caused by the filtering method and the filter properties used in the course of post-processing. The paper proposes new qualification methods and parameters for determining the quality of {FIR} filter banks, taking their use for acoustic evaluation into account. It suggests practical considerations for the design as well, and shows the analysis and comparison of effects of various filter properties -- such as filter types and topology structures -- on some room acoustics parameters. By using the suggested methods, it is possible to derive more accurate and reliable results in room acoustic evaluation.},

The coloration of the reverberation tail is quantified by the modal excitation distribution derived from the modal decomposition of the {FDN}. A homogeneously decaying allpass {FDN} is designed to be colorless such that the corresponding narrow modal excitation distribution leads to a high perceived modal density. Synthetic modal excitation distributions are generated to match modal excitations of {FDNs}. Three listening tests were conducted to demonstrate the correlation between the modal excitation distribution and the perceived degree of coloration. A fourth test shows a significant reduction of coloration by the colorless {FDN} compared to other {FDN} designs. The novel connection of modal excitation, allpass {FDNs}, and perceived coloration presents a beneficial design criterion for colorless artificial reverberation.},

	abstract = {Feedback delay networks ({FDNs}) are recursive filters, which are widely used for artificial reverberation and decorrelation. While there exists a vast literature on a wide variety of reverb topologies, this work aims to provide a unifying framework to design and analyze delay-based reverberators. To this end, we present the Feedback Delay Network Toolbox ({FDNTB}), a collection of the {MATLAB} functions and example scripts. The {FDNTB} includes various representations of {FDNs} and corresponding translation functions. Further, it provides a selection of special feedback matrices, topologies, and attenuation filters. In particular, more advanced algorithms such as modal decomposition, time-varying matrices, and filter feedback matrices are readily accessible. Furthermore, our toolbox contains several additional {FDN} designs. Providing {MATLAB} code under a {GNU}-{GPL} 3.0 license and including illustrative examples, we aim to foster research and education in the field of audio processing.},

            Sounds produced in the world reflect off surrounding surfaces on their way to our ears. Known as reverberation, these reflections distort sound but provide information about the world around us. We asked whether reverberation exhibits statistical regularities that listeners use to separate its effects from those of a sound’s source. We conducted a large-scale statistical analysis of real-world acoustics, revealing strong regularities of reverberation in natural scenes. We found that human listeners can estimate the contributions of the source and the environment from reverberant sound, but that they depend critically on whether environmental acoustics conform to the observed statistical regularities. The results suggest a separation process constrained by knowledge of environmental acoustics that is internalized over development or evolution.
          , 
            In everyday listening, sound reaches our ears directly from a source as well as indirectly via reflections known as reverberation. Reverberation profoundly distorts the sound from a source, yet humans can both identify sound sources and distinguish environments from the resulting sound, via mechanisms that remain unclear. The core computational challenge is that the acoustic signatures of the source and environment are combined in a single signal received by the ear. Here we ask whether our recognition of sound sources and spaces reflects an ability to separate their effects and whether any such separation is enabled by statistical regularities of real-world reverberation. To first determine whether such statistical regularities exist, we measured impulse responses ({IRs}) of 271 spaces sampled from the distribution encountered by humans during daily life. The sampled spaces were diverse, but their {IRs} were tightly constrained, exhibiting exponential decay at frequency-dependent rates: Mid frequencies reverberated longest whereas higher and lower frequencies decayed more rapidly, presumably due to absorptive properties of materials and air. To test whether humans leverage these regularities, we manipulated {IR} decay characteristics in simulated reverberant audio. Listeners could discriminate sound sources and environments from these signals, but their abilities degraded when reverberation characteristics deviated from those of real-world environments. Subjectively, atypical {IRs} were mistaken for sound sources. The results suggest the brain separates sound into contributions from the source and the environment, constrained by a prior on natural reverberation. This separation process may contribute to robust recognition while providing information about spaces around us.},
